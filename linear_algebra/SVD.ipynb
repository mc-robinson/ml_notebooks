    "## A geometric interpretation ## \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by noting this important fact from Trefethen:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The image of the unit sphere under any $m \\times n$ matrix is a hyperellipse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack that statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the *unit sphere* is the sphere in $\\mathbb { R } ^ { n}$, such that the Euclidian norm or $2$-norm is always $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A hyperellipse in $\\mathbb { R } ^ { m }$ is the $m$-dimensional generalization of an ellipse. We can obtain a hyperellipse by stretching the unit sphere in $\\mathbb { R } ^ { m}$ by factors $\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_m$ in the orthogonal directions $\\mathbf{u}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{u}_m \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { m}$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we take the $u_i$ to be unit vectors with $\\|u_i\\|_2 = 1$. The vectors $\\{\\sigma_i u_i\\}$ are then the *principal semiaxes* of the hyperellipse, each with length equal to $\\sigma_i$ (which could equal $0$). In particular, if the matrix $A$ has rank $r$, then exactly $r$ of these principal semiaxes will be nonzero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now actually give a simple picture for this geometric interpretation. We denote the unit sphere in $n$-space as $S $. The hyperellipse in $m$-space, which is the image of $S$ under the mapping $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, is then denoted simply as $AS$. A $2\\times 2$ example from Trefethen is show below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Trefethen_2by2_SVD.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume for simplicity that $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ with $m \\geq n$ hase full rank $n$. The $n$ *singular values* $\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2,...,\\sigma_n$ of $A$ are then the lengths of the $n$ principal semiaxes of the hyperellipse $AS$. We usually number the singular values such that they are in descending order; thus, $\\sigma _ { 1 } \\geq \\sigma _ { 2 } \\geq \\cdots \\geq \\sigma_n > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we denote the $n$ unit vectors $\\left\\{ u _ { 1 } , u _ { 2 } , \\dots , u _ { n } \\right\\}$ representing the directions of the principal semiaxes to be the $n$ *left singular vectors* of A. These vectors are ordered to correspond with their axis lengths  $\\left\\{ \\sigma _ { 1 } , \\sigma _ { 2 } , \\dots , \\sigma _ { n } \\right\\}$. The vector $\\sigma_i u_i$ is thus the $i^{th}$ largest principal semiaxis of $AS$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have the $n$ *right singular vecotrs* of $A$, which are unit vectors $\\left\\{ v _ { 1 } , v _ { 2 } , \\ldots , v _ { n } \\right\\} \\in S$ representing the *preimages* of the principal semiaxes of $AS$. This then means that \n",

    "Putting this into a more compact matrix form, we arrive at the **Reduced SVD**, $A V = \\hat { U } \\hat { \\Sigma }$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Trefethen_reduced_SVD_matrices.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\">\n",

    "where $V$ is an $n\\times n$ matrix with orthonormal columns, $\\hat { U }$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix with orthonormal columns, and $\\hat { \\Sigma }$ is a diagonal $n \\times n$ matrix with the $\\sigma_i$ values on the diagonal. Since $V$ is unitary (the complex equivalent of orthogonal), we can multiply both sides on the right by $V^*$ to obtain\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hats on the matrices signify that they are a par of the *reduced singular value decomposition*. This the form of the SVD factorization of $A$ we usually use in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can turn this reduced SVD into the **Full SVD** by making $\\hat U$ into a unitary matrix $U$. To make $\\hat U$ unitary, it must be square and orthogonal, which we accomplish by appending $m-n$ orthonormal columns to $\\hat U$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To replace $\\hat U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ with $ U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$, we must also require that the size of $\\hat { \\Sigma }$ is changed. Ideally, we want the $m-n$ columns we added to $\\hat U$ to have no effect on our product. Thus, we add $m-n$ zero rows to $\\hat { \\Sigma } \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ to make ${ \\Sigma } \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$. Thus, we arrive at the full SVD\n",

    "$$\n",
    "A = { U } { \\Sigma } V ^ { * }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U$ is $m\\times m$ and unitary, $V$ is $n\\times n$ and unitary, and $\\Sigma$ is $m\\times n$ and diagonal with only positive real entries. Let's compare the two approaches pictorally.\n",

    "As a final note, it is worth mentioning that $A$ need not actually be full rank. If the rank of $A$ is $r < \\min(n,m)$, then $\\Sigma$ will only have $r$ positive entries on the diagonal, with the other diagonal entries equal to $0$. We stil fill out the columns of $U$ and rows of $\\Sigma$, but now with $m-r$ columns and rows, respectively. One additional note is that we must now add $n-r$ orthonormal columns to $V$ in order to fill out the $r$ columns dictated by the geometry."
