    "I have an opinion that is perhaps better left unsaid, but I'll say it anyway: most machine learning books are absolutely terrible at explaining SVMs (Support Vector Machines). Most books mention things like the maximum margin and Lagrange multipliers, but fail to adequetly explain many of the steps in the math. To be fair, many of the books are not purporting to be lengthy math treatises. However, I do think the steps should be clear and there should be more intuition for choosing the \"widest street\" besides \"that one looks the best\" or \"that's the line you would probably draw.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with saying all of these things is that now I am going to try to explain SVMs, and I'll probably do a poor job of it. My tip to all readers is to go read *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Bishop (2006) or *Learning from Data* by Abu-Mostafa *et al.* (2012). These books are excellent and do by far the best job of explaining the concepts.\n",

    "Since these books are amazing, I am actually just going to cover the material that I found extra-confusing about *Hard-margin* SVMs. I repeat, this tutorial will not be extensive, but will instead try to clear up the tricky points. If you are confused, much of the material is derived from the aforementioned books -- I again suggest you give them a read."
